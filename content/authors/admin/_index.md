I am an incoming PhD student at UC Davis, co-advised by [Dr. Daniel Karp](https://karp.ucdavis.edu/) and Dr. Andrew Rypel. 

My research interests are broadly in applied ecology and aquatic conservation, and I aim to use my work to improve consumption of natural resources dually for humans and the organism's we share the earth with.
