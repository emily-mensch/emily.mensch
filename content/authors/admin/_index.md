I a PhD student at UC Davis, co-advised by [Dr. Daniel Karp](https://karp.ucdavis.edu/) and [Dr. Andrew Rypel](https://sites.google.com/view/rypel-lab/home). I recently completed my M.S. with Dr. Michael Wagner and the [Applied Behavioral Ecology Lab](http://www.wagnerlabmsu.com/) in the [Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/fw/), where I studied novel management techniques for the control of invasive sea lamprey in the Laurentian Great Lakes using chemical ecology methods.

My broad research interests are in applied ecology and aquatic conservation, with a particular interest in fish conservation and fisheries management. I aim to use my past, current, and future work to improve consumption of natural resources dually for humans and the organisms we share the earth with. 

Currently, my dissertation research takes place in rice field systems in California's Central Valley. These systems are flooded during winter seasons and used as over-wintering habitat for some water-bird populations, one of the greatest conservation success stories in modern history. I will use a variety of ecological techniques to understand the interactions between fish and birds, with the over-arching goals of the project being to quantify the ecosystem services occurring within this system.
